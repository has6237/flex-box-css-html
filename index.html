				<p><strong>Monkeys</strong> are highly intelligent and social primates, found in diverse habitats across the globe. They're incredibly agile, often swinging through trees with remarkable ease, using their prehensile tails for balance and grip. From the tiny marmoset to the robust baboon, monkeys exhibit a wide range of sizes, colors, and behaviors. Their curious nature and often human-like expressions make them fascinating to observe, whether they're foraging for food or grooming one another.</p>

				<p><strong>Tigers</strong> are the largest of the big cats, instantly recognizable by their distinctive orange fur and unique black stripes, which act like human fingerprints – no two are exactly alike. These powerful apex predators are solitary by nature, roaming vast territories in diverse habitats across Asia, from tropical rainforests to snowy taigas. Unfortunately, tigers are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival. They are excellent swimmers and can take down prey much larger than themselves, relying on their keen senses and ambush hunting techniques.</p>
